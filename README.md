# SipakMed-GAN-ViT
This project focuses on generating synthetic cancer cell images using WGAN on the SipakMed dataset and addressing class imbalance with an Instruction Vision Transformer.

## Features
- Fine-tuned LSUN Generator from WGAN-PyTorch
- Synthetic image generation for cancer cells
- Instruction-ViT for class imbalance handling
## Generated Cancer Cell Images
Here are synthetic cancer cell images generated using WGAN:
