# SipakMed-GAN-ViT
This project focuses on generating synthetic cancer cell images using WGAN on the SipakMed dataset and addressing class imbalance with an Instruction Vision Transformer.

## Features
- Fine-tuned LSUN Generator from WGAN-PyTorch
- Synthetic image generation for cancer cells
- Instruction-ViT for class imbalance handling
## Generated Cancer Cell Images
Here are synthetic cancer cell images generated using WGAN:

## Next Steps
I am currently working on improving the generated images and addressing class imbalance. My next steps include:  

- 📌 **Mathematical Understanding**: Studying the underlying principles behind the WGAN algorithm for better fine-tuning.  
- 🏗 **Handling Class Imbalance**: Using an **Instruction Vision Transformer (ViT)** to rebalance the dataset by generating more underrepresented cancer cell images.  
- 📊 **Evaluation & Refinement**: Comparing the generated images with real ones and refining the generator’s architecture for improved quality.  
- 📝 **Documentation & Updates**: Regularly updating the repository with research findings, model improvements, and new results.  

Stay tuned for further updates! 🚀
